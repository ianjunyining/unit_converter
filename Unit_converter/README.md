# Notes
If you are viewing this Unit Converter I would thank you for doing that. Me as the the creator when I first saw this I had fun with it and now I am a expert at it. I learned streamlit in 1 day ( Almost all the functions the python library has ). I had lots of fun coding this thing and I will make another project in the future. When I learned streamlit it was kind of easy but now learning after 1 day it became easier than the first time I coded with it. I discovered function after function and now I almost know the whole library. I also learned that it is a data based library to make websites and that you can't make clicker games or some other games. I really like this project because converting length, speed, and weight is hard but I did it.
